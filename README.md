## Design
### Specifications
According to the Flag code of India, the Indian flag has a width:height aspect ratio of 3:2. All three horizontal bands of the flag (saffron, white and green) are equally sized. The Ashoka Chakra has twenty-four evenly-spaced spokes.


The size of the Ashoka Chakra is not specified in the flag code, but in section 4.3.1 of "IS1: Manufacturing standards for the Indian Flag", there is a chart that describes specific sizes of the flag and the chakra (reproduced alongside).

## Symbolism 
Bhagwa or the Saffron denotes renunciation or disinterestedness. 

Our leaders must be indifferent to material gains and dedicate themselves to their work. 

The white in the centre is light, the path of truth to guide our conduct. 

The green shows our relation to (the) soil, our relation to the plant life here, on which all other life depends. 

The "Ashoka Chakra" in the centre of the white is the wheel of the law of dharma. Truth or satya, dharma or virtue ought to be the controlling principle of those who work under this flag.

Again, the wheel denotes motion. There is death in stagnation. There is life in movement. 
 
India should no more resist change, it must move and go forward. The wheel represents the dynamism of a peaceful change.
